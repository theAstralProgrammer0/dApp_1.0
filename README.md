# Building A dApp Tutorial

## Understanding What A dApp Is

### Why?

Before building anything, we must know why we are investing our time and
attention in it before diving into it.

### What's A dApp Anyway?

A dApp (decentralized application) is an application whose backend logic is built using smart contracts.
Unlike traditional applications, dApp data are decentralized and immutable. The dApp runs on a blockchain network.

### What're Smart Contracts?

A smart contract is a program written in Solidity. It is the code which spells
out the backend logic (or business logic) of the decentralized application.
Essentially, it's the driving mechanism of how the dApp operates and influences the frontend.
